# GenderVoiceRecognition
Gender voice recognition by speech analysis.
The aim of this project is to predict male or female voices depending on the data.
The dataset is taken from kaggle
In order to distinguish between the voices we use acoustic properties such as mean frequency,skew,mode etc.
These acoustic properties are preprocessed in python language.
We fit and predict models using differnt machine learning techniques.
Random Forest Classification has proven to be the best.
